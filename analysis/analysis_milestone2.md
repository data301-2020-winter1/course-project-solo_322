# Analysis (Outdated: refer to milestone3.ipynb for the most recent and final version of the analysis)

## DataFrame 1

*Do educational qualifications vary based on age or gender?*

- The plot shows the distribution of education level of the respondents against their age.
- While there is not much of visible difference based on gender, the trend of age with education seems clear for some colleges and high schools.
- The average age for people with higher education is less than those having lower educational qualifications.
- This is important even for further analysis because for future analysis, the impact of educational qualifications on various responses and acts would be studied.
- Also, the mean age of our respondents is higher than expected (around 52 years)


## DataFrame 2

*Do people realize the importance of elections?*

- The question under focus is how important it is to vote in elections as part of being an American.
- The alternatives provided were 1-4 with 1 being the highest and 4 being the lowest.
- It can be clearly observed, and quite interestingly, that older people tend to realize the importance of voting more than the young ones.
- This is one of the major findings necessary to evaluate in the future by cross referencing it against few other questions.
- It is also feasible to say that, on average, there is not much of a difference in opinion based on gender.


## DataFrame 3

*Do people think that the design and structure of the American Government need change?*

- The plot portrays the response to whether the respondents believe that the structure and design of the American government needs changing.
- It can be analysed that for regular and frequent voters, the opinion is balanced midway i.e. 50-50. 
- For people who rarely or never vote, a higher number thinks that change is required.
- It would be interesting to dwell further into this and understand why do some people not vote even when they want to see change.
- Possibly because of certain other issue which will be studied moving forward as the available data is plenty.
